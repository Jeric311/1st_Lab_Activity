    <h2>Nature Vibe is Ask any avid nature traveler how he or she first began to make a lifelong attachment to the outdoors, the natural world or a particular species of wildlife, and you’ll get as many anecdotes as the individuals you query. It may have started with a childhood, weekend camping trip and nights spent under the stars, a road trip to an iconic national park with parents, a first fishing expedition or even a backyard fort cobbled together on Saturdays with materials found in the woods.

        But what exactly is nature, this thing that once experienced keeps drawing us in and tugging at our hearts? Is there one, conclusive definition of it?
        
        According to The Merriam-Webster Dictionary, nature is “a creative and controlling force in the universe,” “the external world in its entirety” or “humankind’s original condition.” The New Oxford American Dictionary describes nature as “the phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations”; “the basic or inherent features of something, especially when seen as characteristic of it”; or “the innate or essential qualities or character of a person or animal.”</h2>
